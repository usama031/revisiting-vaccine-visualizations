# Revisiting Vaccine Visualizations

**Revisiting Vaccine Visualizations** is a data analysis and visualization project focused on visualizing global vaccine distribution, coverage rates, and impact. This project aims to provide insights into vaccination efforts across different countries and regions, particularly in response to pandemics such as COVID-19. By reimagining how vaccine data is represented, this project seeks to highlight disparities, trends, and the broader impact of vaccination campaigns on public health.

## Introduction

The global distribution of vaccines has become one of the most critical factors in combating infectious diseases. Vaccination not only prevents the spread of diseases but also reduces the severity of infections, saving millions of lives. However, despite the importance of vaccines, there are significant disparities in vaccine distribution and coverage across different countries and regions.

The **Revisiting Vaccine Visualizations** project is designed to explore and visualize vaccine data in a more intuitive and accessible way. By using a variety of visualization techniques and tools, the project seeks to provide a clearer understanding of vaccine coverage, effectiveness, and distribution over time.

This project focuses primarily on vaccines for COVID-19, but the methods and visualizations can be extended to other vaccines as well.

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to reimagine how vaccine data is visualized, making it easier to understand vaccine distribution, progress, and disparities. Some of the main objectives include:

- **Visualizing Global Vaccine Coverage**: Track vaccination rates by country, region, and globally.
- **Comparing Vaccination Efforts**: Compare vaccination rates across different regions, highlighting disparities.
- **Exploring Vaccine Impact**: Correlate vaccination rates with COVID-19 case numbers, hospitalizations, and mortality rates.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Create interactive visualizations to explore trends and data at a granular level.

By revisiting how we visualize vaccination data, the project aims to provide actionable insights for policymakers, researchers, and the general public.

## Key Visualizations

The project includes several key visualizations that allow users to better understand the global vaccination landscape. Some of the main visualizations include:

1. **Global Vaccine Coverage Over Time**: A line graph that shows the global percentage of the population vaccinated over time, with breakdowns by continent and country.
2. **Vaccine Distribution by Region**: A choropleth map showing vaccine distribution rates by country, allowing users to easily compare vaccination coverage globally.
3. **Vaccination vs. Infection Rates**: A scatter plot or line chart showing the correlation between vaccination rates and the number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in different countries or regions.
4. **Vaccine Inequity**: A heatmap or bar chart highlighting the disparities in vaccine coverage between high-income and low-income countries.
5. **Time-to-Vaccinate**: A chart comparing how long it takes different countries to achieve specific vaccination milestones (e.g., 50%, 70%, 90% coverage).
6. **Vaccine Impact Analysis**: Visualize how vaccination campaigns have affected infection rates, mortality rates, and healthcare systems.

## Data Sources

This project relies on publicly available vaccination data from trusted sources:

- **Our World in Data**: Provides up-to-date data on COVID-19 vaccinations by country and region, including the number of people vaccinated, vaccine doses administered, and coverage rates.
- **World Health Organization (WHO)**: Offers comprehensive health statistics, including vaccine coverage data for multiple diseases and global immunization trends.
- **Johns Hopkins University**: Supplies COVID-19 case numbers, deaths, and hospitalizations, which can be correlated with vaccine distribution data.
- **National Health Agencies**: Provides country-specific vaccination data (e.g., CDC, NHS, etc.).

The datasets are regularly updated and can be accessed via APIs or downloaded as CSV files for analysis.
